* Are Biological Systems Poised at Criticality?


* Thermodynamics for a network of neurons: Signatures of criticality
** Introduction
Want to find "thermodynamic limit" for neurons.
** Theory
- System of /N/ elements, each element has state \sigma_{i}_{}, system state defined by \sigma{}={\sigma_{i},...,\sigma_{N}).

- Standard thermodynamics apply.

- Want to estimate density of states, /n(E)/.

- Get entropy from density of states: $S = ln(n(E))$


** An Experimental Example
- Extracted neuron firing counts from salamander visual center while it watched a movie
- Showed seemingly correlated clusters of neuron's firing.






* Temporal organization of ongoing brain activity
** Introduction
*** Stochastic process
*** Study power structure
**** See long range correlations, periodic oscillations
*** Study avalanche waiting times
** Ongoing activity: Temporal structure
*** Activity is sequence of up-states
**** Up-states last from 1ms ~ 100ms
*** Up-states generally not periodic
*** Up-states seperated by periods of no activity (down-states)
*** Up-states can be viewed as stochastic process

*** Distribution of jumps between waiting times has been studied
**** Jumps in sequence of wating times
The quantity \Delta{}i=\Delta{}t(i+1)-\Delta{}t(i) where \Delta{}t is the time between avalanches.
***** The distribution of \Delta{}i is a symmetric Levy distribution   
The probability density function of the LÃ©vy distribution over the domain x\ge \mu is:
f(x:\mu,c)= \sqrt{c/2\pi} \times e^{-c/2(x-\mu)}/(x-\mu)^{3/2}
*** Distributions of waiting times \Delta{}t=t^i_{j+1}-t^i_j is analyzed
*** Rat cortical slices were studied
** Neuronal network model for ongoing brain activity
*** Neuron update scheme:
\nu_j(t+1)=\nu_{j }\pm{} (v_{j}\cdot{}k_{out})/(k_{in_j}) \times (g_{ij})\(\sum_{k}g_{ik}) 
*** Weight update scheme:
**** If the connections were used:
 g_{ij}_{}(\tau+1) = g_{ij}_{}(\tau) + |\delta\nu_{j}(\tau)|/\nu_{max}
**** If the connections were not used:
\Delta{}g = \sum_{ij}\delta{}g_{ij}/N_{B}
Where N_{B} is the number of non-zero connections
*** Up-down state dynamics
**** Up states
When the avalanche strength (S_{\Delta{}V}) is less than a threshold, S_{\Delta{}Vmin}, the network remains in, or transitions to an  "up state" by resetting neurons to a depolarized value.
\nu_{i}(\tau+1) = \nu_{max}[1-S_{\Delta{}V}_{}(\tau)/S_{\Delta{}Vmin}]
***** TODO Check different S_{\Delta{}Vmin}'s
**** Down states
When the last avalache strength (S_{\Delta{}V}) is larger than a threshold, S_{\Delta{}Vmin}_{}, the network transitions into a "down state" by hyperpolarizing the neurons proportional to their previous activity.
\nu_{i}_{}(\tau+1) = \nu_{i}(\tau) - h\cdot{}\delta{}\nu_{i}(\tau)
**** Noise and driving terms
***** Up states
In an up-state the noise is drawn from the interval d_{u}_{}(\tau+1)=[0,S_{\Delta{}Vmin}/S_{\Delta{}V}_{}(\tau)]
***** Down states
In a down-state, the noise has a small constant amplitude applied at a random site.
** Temporal organization of avalanches
The ratio R\tilde{}h/S_{\Delta{}Vmin}\approx 10^{-4} produces best replica of experimental results.


* The balance between excitation and inhibition controls the temporal organization of neuronal avalanches
** Introduction
Neuron timesteps are on the order of \tilde{} 10ms

- Recorded rat cortex via 60 channel multielectrode array (in vitro).


- *Pharmacology*: "To study propagation under reduced inhibition, the noncompetitive GABAA-receptor antagonist picrotoxin (2 \mu{}M; Invitrogen, Gaithersburg, MD) was bath-applied. Event size distributions were calculated based on 5 hr spontaneous activity before and during drug application and 24 hr after recovery (see below). In acute slices, spontaneous activity was induced by bath perfusion with the glutamate-receptor agonist NMDA (6 \mu{}M in ACSF; Sigma) in combination with the dopamine D1-receptor agonist (\pm{})-SKF-38393 (5 \mu{}M in ACSF; Sigma). Preliminary experiments revealed that the combination of both drugs at those concentrations robustly induced synchronized local field potentials (LFPs), for an average of 0.4 hr in the acute slice."

They appear to be soaking the cortex slices in these receptor agonists in order to get spontaninous neuron firings. I'm not sure how biologically relevent this is.

- =Neurons fired (local field potentials) for ~20ms.=

They used an imposed refractory period? As in they didn't count from a neuron if it previously fired?

- "Synchronized bursting separated by many seconds of quiescence is considered a hallmark of mature cortical networks grown in isolation"



- =They see ~exponential relationship between number of avalanches vs avalanche length.=

- =They see a power law in the size of avalanches=

- "In this case, avalanche size was expressed as the absolute sum of LFP amplitudes over all electrodes with LFPs above threshold and ranged from just a few to several thousands of microvolts, thereby covering several orders of magnitude. Again, a simple power law described the probability of finding avalanches for a given field size, whether expressed in absolute LFP amplitudes or multiples of average LFP amplitude (Fig. 3B, inset). =The dependence of the exponent \alpha{} in these power laws based on LFP amplitudes was identical to that found when measuring avalanche size based on number of active electrodes only="


- "Thus, the power laws captured the distribution of the widely varying spatiotemporal patterns in a simple equation. They also indicated a fundamental =scale invariance of network dynamics= over many orders of magnitude (in this case, involving either a few neurons or an entire neuronal network)"

 - =characteristic exponent of -3/2=
