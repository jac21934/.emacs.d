Over the summer, from June 1st to August 12, I will work at the Parallel Computing Summer Internship at Los Alamos National Lab, where I intend to get a better handle on parallel computing, so that I can extend the neural network code I have already written to more effeciently use the resources of the Condor and T-Bird clusters at Virginia Tech.
