\noindent Hey Ada everything looks really good. I do have some suggestions about word choice and stuff that I've enumerated below

\section*{Introduction}
\label{sec-1}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``The goal of our research was to measure and analyze neuronal avalanches and their statistics under a variety of conditions.'' 

\emph{Change was to is.}

\item ``We seek to accomplish this by performing numerical simulations of neural networks with a number of parameters.''

\sl{ I would suggest something more like: "We seek to accomplish this by performing numerical simulations of model neural networks that are constructed to mimic the dynamics and high dimensionality of biological neural networks."}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Numerical Model}
\label{sec-2}

\begin{itemize}
\item ``Because this introduces a correlation between the potentials of the neurons and their previous activity, this essentially introduces a sort of short term memory of the previous state of the entire network on the level of individual neurons.''

\emph{Need to cite Archangelis here.}
\end{itemize}

\section*{Results}
\label{sec-3}

The only problem I have here are the font sizes of the plot axes lables and markers are small. Uwe really likes big lables, so if feasible I recommend you go back and make them as large as possible.
