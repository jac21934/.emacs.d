This last semester I have been working towards recreating and understanding the results of the papers written by Lucille de Archangelis[1,2,3]. With help of undergraduate researcher Ada Warren, I believe we have made a large amount of progress towards this goal. Specifically we now understand the source of the strange avalanche time distribution as an effect of their programmed in noise, which changes depending on the state of the network. With this noise implemented, Ada has reported that he seems to be able to recreate their results, though many parameters need to be fine tuned. It is unknown if this noise is completely valid from a biological perspective, so our next steps are to determine this within the next month, and if it is not implement our own noise term.

Additionally in the search to understand the dynamics of these networks we have also uncovered an interesting avalanche strength distribution which shows power law behavior, followed by a local peak in the distribution. We do not fully understand the mechanisms causing this distribution, and need to look into this in greater detail. 

I also presented the work on surface plasmon resonance cells I finished in Fall 2016, both at the 2017 APS March Meeting in New Orleans, and at the Second Molecular Biophysics Symposium where I won a shared award for giving the best short talk. 

Over the summer, from June 1st to August 12, I will work at the Parallel Computing Summer Internship at Los Alamos National Lab, where I intend to get a better handle on parallel computing so that I can extend the neural network code I have already written to more efficiently use the resources of the Condor and T-Bird clusters at Virginia Tech, allowing us to reach larger network sizes.
