* Research:                                                       :Research: 
** Neural Networks
*** Power law relations
How does the power law relate to noise strength in the neurons?
In the weights?
*** Where does the hump come from?
The weight seems to go away with weight noise. Some sort of smoothing effect.
**** DONE Need to find crossover regime for hump dissapearance.
DEADLINE: <2017-04-23 Sun>

** Pruning effects?
** TODO Avalanche time distributions
DEADLINE: <2017-04-23 Sun>
*** Alter h and R and ave_max?
Try and find regime where power law distrubution occurs
