* Neuroscience: Exploring the Brain
Cell body, perikaryon, and Soma are interchangable.
Thin tubes out of the soma are the neurites: dendrites and axons.
** Soma
The soma is filled with a salty, potassium rich solution called "cytosol".

Insidethe soma are also membrane enclosed strucures called "organelles".
 

** Axons and Dendrites
Axons are the main transmiting "wire" for neurons, and can reach lengths of a meter or more.
Dendrites branch off at right angles from the axon, and connect to axons of other neurons.
